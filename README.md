# Hi, I am Alex 🙋🏻

I am a mechatronics engineer with experience in the development and testing of power electronics. Seeking to broaden my expertise, I ventured into software engineering at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de). Completing the Core Curriculum was a transformative experience, revealing both the vast knowledge I had gained and the endless horizon of learning still ahead. Embracing this lifelong journey, I am now continuing my studies at 42 Rio in Brazil starting the AI specialization path at [42 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil🇧🇷](https://42.rio).

My goal is to contribute to projects/products that have a positive impact on society like environment🌱, education📚, sustainable mobility🚄 or the health sector🩺.

In my spare time you can find me having fun at skatepark 🛹, where I embrace the journey of success and failure, and learn valuable life lessons and resilience along the way 💆🏻‍♂️.
